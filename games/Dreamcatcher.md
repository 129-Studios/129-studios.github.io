# About the game 'Dreamcatcher'

In a post-apocalyptic world scorned by old warmachines and mutants, Aila harvests and sells dreams from the ethereal realm until she faces Araun, Eater of Dreams.

â€œDreamcatcher" transports players into a hauntingly beautiful post-apocalyptic world named Urud, where dreams have become a rare and coveted commodity. In this gripping video game, you assume the role of Aila, a young girl blessed with druidic powers that allow her to venture into the ethereal realm and capture dreams. In a world where the once-vibrant dreamscape has withered, leaving the residents of Urud without the solace and inspiration of slumber visions, dreamcatchers like Aila have emerged as the last hope for a weary population. Players must guide Aila through a perilous landscape overrun by menacing war robots from bygone conflicts, intent on eradicating the last remnants of humanity. As you navigate this beautifully desolate world, you'll not only battle mechanical foes and monsters, but also unravel the mysteries of the past, find meaning in helping others in need and making crucial decisions that shape the future of both dreams and reality. "Dreamcatcher" seamlessly blends action, exploration, and a compelling narrative, allowing players to harness Aila's druidic abilities to capture dreams of hope, fear, and wonder. These dreams can be harnessed as currency, traded for essential resources, or used to unveil hidden truths about the apocalypse that reshaped the world. With stunning visuals, an evocative soundtrack, and a deep, emotionally charged story, "Dreamcatcher" challenges players to navigate a world where dreams hold the power to reshape reality, and where the fate of Urud rests in the hands of one brave dreamcatcher. Will you save the world from impending doom, or succumb to the encroaching darkness of a dreamless future? The choice is yours in this unforgettable, post-apocalyptic adventure.
